# Handoff — ADR 0024 adopted: Lorehaven is the from-scratch base; docs realigned

Date: 2026-09-24. Previous handoff (M51 media resilience + M12 mentions + M7
device delivery, v0.51.0+2) is archived at
`docs/handoffs/2026-09-23T112310+0200-m51-media-resilience-m12-mentions-m7-device-delivery-handoff.md`.

## What happened this session

A consolidated from-scratch specification was written (session copy:
`/tmp/ficarchive-from-scratch-spec.md`) by auditing both codebases — FicNexus
(`~/code/rust/ficnexus`, built 2026-07-25 → 09-09, plus `fanfic-scrapers`
and `fanfic-archivist-bot`) and Lorehaven. Decision (ADR 0024): **Lorehaven
is the base**; the from-scratch spec is its target state. Adapting FicNexus
would be architectural surgery (single-dialect Postgres + pgvector/tsvector,
load-bearing Redis, XP/levels to remove, ~150 write routes with opt-in
enforcement per its own REBUILD-NOTES). Adapting Lorehaven is mostly
completion. Estimate at observed pace (~11 requirements/day): 6–9 weeks
concentrated + 2–3 week backgroundable adapter tail.

## Files changed (all in ~/code-local/rust/lorehaven, uncommitted)

- `docs/adr/0024-lorehaven-as-base.md` — **new**. The decision, port sources,
  spec amendments, effort estimate.
- `docs/spec.md` — front-matter ADR-0024 note; **§16.1a** strategy registry
  (RecStrategy trait, RRF k=60, `rec.mode`, golden legacy-parity test);
  **§11.16** adapter porting backlog (fanfic-scrapers as port source,
  fixture-gated, `blocked-here` status); **§23.2** amended (bot port source
  fanfic-archivist-bot).
- `docs/plans/remaining-work.md` — **new**. The forward plan: M52 rec
  registry, M53 adapter batch 1, M54 bot port, M55 OpenAPI publication, M56
  M45/M47 residuals; verified current-state summary.
- `docs/requirements.csv` — repaired 9 malformed rows (unquoted-comma bug
  shifted columns; M33/M34/M35 series), added M52-01…M55-02 (16 planned
  rows). Now 246 rows, 0 malformed: 177 implemented (172 locally-tested,
  5 fully-tested), 65 planned, 4 unsupported.
- `README.md` — status section rewritten: was stale ("M0–M5 complete, M6
  partly built"); now the verified state (177/230 original rows implemented,
  tags through v0.51.0, milestone-series table).
- `docs/plans/README.md`, `docs/plans/junior-implementation-plan.md` —
  superseded-status notes pointing at remaining-work.md.
- `docs/spec-gaps-ficnexus.md` — status header: resolved by ADR 0024 with
  the resolution map (kept as audit trail).

## Verified current state (evidence: requirements.csv + git log + tests)

177 of 230 original rows implemented. 51 milestone test files (M0–M45),
migrations to 0071 in both dialects, 37 frontend routes, 11 scraper
adapters, tags through `v0.51.0`. Series built: platform core M0–M15,
marketplace/translation/API/admin M16–M26, forum M31–M35, directory/fork/
half-life/CTAs/ordering/roadmap-consensus/settings M39–M47, media
resilience M48–M51. Planned rows remaining: M45 (46, taste-arena
residuals), M47 (3, settings surfaces), plus the new M52–M55.

## Next steps (priority order)

1. **Commit this docs change** (docs-only; no code touched).
2. **M52 rec strategy registry** first — freezes neutral behavior before
   further influence work. Spec §16.1a; rows M52-01…08 already in the CSV.
   Golden legacy-parity test comes first: freeze `discovery::blend` output
   on fixtures before writing the registry.
3. **M53 adapter batch 1** (ffnet, ao3, royalroad, fictionpress, ficbook,
   syosetu → 10 verified adapters). Port parse logic only, from
   `~/code/rust/fanfic-scrapers` (read-only reference).
4. M54 bot port, M55 OpenAPI, M56 M45/M47 residuals.
5. Then: 3 known E2E failures (worker timing, download verification,
   subscription unread count), tag v1.0.0, deploy to thinkcentre.
6. Run `scripts/seed_roadmap.py` after committing — the 16 new planned rows
   appear as `idea` cards (ADR 0023: the CSV is the board seed).

## What to pass along

- The from-scratch spec lives at `/tmp/ficarchive-from-scratch-spec.md`
  (session scratch, 24h-pruned — copy into the repo if wanted durable; it
  was deliberately not committed because spec.md + ADR 0024 now carry its
  content).
- FicNexus / fanfic-scrapers / fanfic-archivist-bot are **read-only port
  sources**. Never run git/cargo/npm under `~/code/rust/*` (SSHFS risk);
  copy files out to read them.
- The 9 repaired CSV rows were quoting bugs (unquoted commas in the
  requirement column shifting everything right). Validator: 7 columns, id
  matches `M\d+-\d+`, status in {planned, implemented-locally-tested,
  implemented-fully-tested, unsupported}.
- Carried from previous handoff: M6-10 preservation batches and M6-15
  aggregate mode remain deliberately unsupported; the scraper-bot adaptation
  gap is now M54 (planned) instead of "explored, not ported"; Obscura
  integration, the 40k rescrape and the webnovel-scraper port remain
  unstarted and unscheduled.

## Environment quirks (unchanged)

- **Work in local clone** `~/code-local/rust/lorehaven`. `~/code/rust/lorehaven` is SSHFS — never run git/cargo/npm through it.
- Daily sync: `lorehaven-sync.timer`, 09:00.
- Playwright E2E runs ON thinkcentre over SSH (`frontend/e2e/serve-scratch.sh`).
- Deployed instance: thinkcentre `127.0.0.1:8081`, admin credentials in `~/.hermes/.env`.
- **Frontend builds need to run ON thinkcentre** — the embedded bundle (`frontend/dist/`) is built into the binary with `rust-embed`.
- Build on thinkcentre: `pkill -9 cargo` first; binary swap needs `pkill -9 -f "lorehaven serve"`.
- Argon2 params: m_cost=19456, t_cost=2, p_cost=1.
- Rate limiter buckets are process-global (`GLOBAL_BUCKETS` in `limiter.rs`), keyed by IP.
- Lint false positive: the write_file/patch tool's linter runs rustc with Rust 2015 edition and reports `async fn` errors — ignore those; `cargo check` is the real gate.

## Gotchas (carried forward, still true)

- Spoilers routes passed `pseud_id` where DB FK'd `accounts(id)` — fixed with `RequirePseud { user, .. }` → `user.account_id`.
- Config `rate_limits` field has no top-level `burst`/`per_minute` — nested in each `Quota`.
- Comment POST returns **200** with `{id, receipt}`, not 201.
- `forum_categories` has no repo-level `create_category`; tests seed via raw SQL.
- **NewTopicForm** input ID must be `#topic-title` (tests expect this).
- **Work page** shows chapter titles in a list; clicking opens the reader.
- **Docs pages**: sections appear in both body and TOC — use `.first()` with `getByText`.
- Community category navigation: `/community/forums/<id>` requires waiting for the `Topics` heading.

## How to resume

Read ADR 0024, then `docs/plans/remaining-work.md` §M52 — it names the spec
section (§16.1a), the rows (M52-01…08), and the port source. Start with the
golden legacy-parity test.
