# Verification log — Lorehaven

Newest first. Each section states what was verified, how, and the result.

## 2026-09-15 (afternoon) — review pass over the 08:45–13:43 work

Scope: the 14 commits `999fe4c..01a6bcf` (notifications backend, PG dialect
fixes, forum pages, pricing UI, Playwright e2e, backend-aware harness) plus
the work session's gate-metrics commits. Everything below was re-run by the
review, not taken from session prose.

### Review fixes (committed by the review)

- `ci.yml`: the golden-path journey step carried literal `***` passwords
  (redaction leaked into the committed file — those jobs could never
  authenticate), and the push trigger listed `main` while the branch is
  `master`. Fixed both.
- `scripts/postgres-journey.sh`: the baked-in scratch-container credentials
  stopped working (the container's data dir was re-initialized, so neither
  the script's nor the container env's password matched). The script now
  requires `DATABASE_URL` and `PSQL` instead of failing mysteriously;
  CI passes both explicitly.
- `docs/requirements.csv`: 9 rows (M10-01..05, M11-05, M12-01, M12-02,
  M21-05) had been rewritten with `requirement="Done"`, `milestone=<date>`,
  `status="3/3"`, destroying the requirement text and the ledger schema.
  Restored from the pre-image; kept the honest evidence notes the rewrites
  had added; dropped M12-02's stale "Trust gate still TODO" tail (the gate
  is implemented and tested: `a_trust_gate_rejects_underleveled_posters`).
- `notifications` mark-read: a non-uuid path id returned 204 on SQLite but
  500 on PostgreSQL (`$2::uuid` cast). Now parsed first → 404 on both
  dialects.
- `Community.svelte`: `role="tablist"` moved from `<nav>` to a `<div>`
  (svelte-check a11y warning, pre-existing).

### Gates (all re-run on the reviewed tree + review fixes)

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check` ✅
- `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` ✅
- `cargo test --workspace` (SQLite) ✅ 1087 passed / 0 failed, 37 binaries
- frontend: `fe.sh test` ✅ 147 tests / 22 files; `fe.sh check` ✅ 0 errors,
  0 warnings
- `scripts/postgres-journey.sh` against live PostgreSQL ✅ 67 steps, 0 failed
- Playwright e2e (`fe.sh e2e`, real Chromium, scratch SQLite) ✅ 2 passed

### True PostgreSQL milestone matrix (backend-aware harness, `--no-fail-fast`)

`LOREHAVEN_TEST_PG_URL=<admin url> cargo test -p lorehaven-app --no-fail-fast`
against the live PG 17 container:

- 23 targets: **333 passed / 48 failed**
- fully green (7): app lib unittests, milestone_0, milestone_3 (auth),
  milestone_10 (search), milestone_11 (discovery), milestone_14 (events)
- partial (16): milestone_12 (8/9), milestone_13 (8/1), milestone_15 (4/2),
  milestone_16 (5/1), milestone_17 (3/3), milestone_18 (5/2),
  milestone_19 (3/2), milestone_2 (26/1), milestone_21 (22/1),
  milestone_4 (18/2), milestone_5 (19/3), milestone_6 (27/7),
  milestone_7 (4/6), milestone_8 (9/1), milestone_9 (5/2),
  revision_cache (5/5)
- fully red: none — every suite makes progress on PG

The earlier claim "core PG modules verified green: M2, M10, M11, M21" was
true for M10/M11 but optimistic for M2 and M21 (one failure each — M2's is
the documented rate-limit flake, which passes in isolation, re-verified:
27/27). The drift list below replaces the previous one, which named
milestone_14 (now green) and missed milestone_2/5/12/21.

### Known PG drift (remaining 48 failures, by defect class)

Plan file: `~/.hermes/plans/2026-09-15-lorehaven-pg-parity.md`. Classes:

- community.rs comment/conversation/message/mute queries — 500s
  (milestone_12, 9 tests) — the casts scoped in the work session, not yet
  landed
- `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET count = count + 1` — `count` ambiguous on PG
  (42702) in abuse/usage counter upserts (milestone_15, milestone_19)
- translation `shared`/`case_sensitive` INTEGER-vs-BOOLEAN (42804)
  (milestone_17)
- exports uuid decode — String vs UUID (milestone_7, milestone_6)
- single-test 500s in the same cast class (milestone_4 notes, milestone_13
  challenge enter, milestone_16 listings, milestone_9 taxonomy)
- milestone_5 job cancel/checkpoint semantics on PG (needs investigation,
  not just casts)
- milestone_18 bot/api-scope db path reaches `sqlite_pool()` under PG
  (code defect)
- test-side: milestone_12 category seed 42601; milestone_21 direct
  `sqlite_pool()` in a test
- milestone_2 rate-limit test: parallel-load flake (green in isolation)

## 2026-09-15 (morning) — backend-aware harness + core PG fixes

What the work session landed (verified by the afternoon review above):

- **test-support crate** (`crates/test-support/`) — backend-aware test
  harness (`TestDb`); all 19 milestone test files + `revision_cache`
  converted. Setting `LOREHAVEN_TEST_PG_URL` runs the same suite on
  PostgreSQL with a fresh scratch database per test.
- **PG dialect fixes** in migrations 0011/0012/0013 (uuid/bigint/boolean
  columns), `search.rs` `$1` double-bind, `ast_search.rs` uuid casts,
  `discovery.rs` casts + bigint decode, `community.rs` presence boolean.
- **m2 rate-limit test** — flaky under parallel load (shared loopback +
  global limiter); passes in isolation on both backends.
- **Dogfood pass** (docs/dogfood-2026-09-15.md): nine findings, eight fixed
  with tests — notifications had no backend at all, pricing accepted any
  caller (security), money ledger wrote a fake "platform" account, forum
  category links 404'd, PG dialect drift across 0021/0022/monetization,
  discovery rendered raw uuids, forum authors rendered as uuids, no author
  pricing UI; service-worker staleness documented for operators.
